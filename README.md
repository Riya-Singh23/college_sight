Introducing to you â€œCollege Sight".
A secure unified platform that acts the nervous system of the College.
Your student email id is the key ensuring only verified students and alumni who could access to the academic family.

This platform will be built on three core pillars:
1. Easy Access:
Things will be organised logically and according the college, major course and the year helping to access notes and insights from the seniors and alumni.
2. Communication without barriers:
A comment system that turns every question into a real time doubt solving session with seniors, classmates and alumni.
3. Knowledge that sticks:
Flashcards and evolving FAQs will be created to ensure that knowledge grows with every contribution.

This platform is not just to gather human potential and knowledge together, but to help students / freshers to connect and get familiar with what they are going deal with in the future academics and built collective intelligence.
We're not just building another study app. We're creating a place where students help students. Where knowledge stays and grows. Where no one has to figure things out alone.
